description: This well-received 1922 collection of poems launched Roberts's literary
  career. Many of the poems charmingly recreate the world of childhood in much the
  manner of Robert Louis Stevenson's A child's garden of verses . Poems include, Mumps,"
  "Milking time," "Big brother," and "The pulpit."
