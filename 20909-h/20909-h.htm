THE SKY
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw a shadow on the ground
</p>
<p>
And heard a bluejay going by;
</p>
<p>
A shadow went across the ground,
</p>
<p>
And I looked up and saw the sky.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It hung up on the poplar tree,
</p>
<p>
But while I looked it did not stay;
</p>
<p>
It gave a tiny sort of jerk
</p>
<p>
And moved a little bit away.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And farther on and farther on
</p>
<p>
It moved and never seemed to stop.
</p>
<p>
I think it must be tied with chains
</p>
<p>
And something pulls it from the top.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It never has come down again,
</p>
<p>
And every time I look to see,
</p>
<p>
The sky is always slipping back
</p>
<p>
And getting far away from me.

THE CORNFIELD
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I went across the pasture lot
</p>
<p>
When not a one was watching me.
</p>
<p>
Away beyond the cattle barns
</p>
<p>
I climbed a little crooked tree.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And I could look down on the field
</p>
<p>
And see the corn and how it grows
</p>
<p>
Across the world and up and down
</p>
<p>
In very straight and even rows.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And far away and far away&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I wonder if the farmer man
</p>
<p>
Knows all about the corn and how
</p>
<p>
It comes together like a fan.

MILKING TIME
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When supper time is almost come,
</p>
<p>
But not quite here, I cannot wait,
</p>
<p>
And so I take my china mug
</p>
<p>
And go down by the milking gate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The cow is always eating shucks
</p>
<p>
And spilling off the little silk.
</p>
<p>
Her purple eyes are big and soft&#8212;
</p>
<p>
She always smells like milk.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And Father takes my mug from me,
</p>
<p>
And then he makes the stream come out.
</p>
<p>
I see it going in my mug
</p>
<p>
And foaming all about.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when it's piling very high,
</p>
<p>
And when some little streams commence
</p>
<p>
To run and drip along the sides,
</p>
<p>
He hands it to me through the fence.

IN MY PILLOW
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When Mother or Father turns down the light,
</p>
<p>
I like to look into my pillow at night.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Some people call them dreams, but for me
</p>
<p>
They are things I look down in my pillow and see.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw some birds, as many as four,
</p>
<p>
That were all blue wings and nothing else more.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Without any head and without any feet,
</p>
<p>
Just blue wings flying over a street.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And almost every night I see
</p>
<p>
A little brown bowl that can talk to me,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A nice little bowl that laughs and sings,
</p>
<p>
And ever so many other things.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sometimes they are plainer than I can say,
</p>
<p>
And while I am waking they go away.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when nobody is coming by,
</p>
<p>
I feel my pillow all over and try
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And try to feel the pretty things,
</p>
<p>
The little brown bowl and the flying wings.

MISS KATE-MARIE
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And it was Sunday everywhere,
</p>
<p>
And Father pinned a rose on me
</p>
<p>
And said he guessed he'd better take
</p>
<p>
Me down to see Miss Kate-Marie.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when I went it all turned out
</p>
<p>
To be a Sunday school, and there
</p>
<p>
Miss Kate-Marie was very good
</p>
<p>
And let me stand beside her chair.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her hat was made of yellow lace;
</p>
<p>
Her dress was very soft and thin,
</p>
<p>
And when she talked her little tongue
</p>
<p>
Was always wriggling out and in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I liked to smell my pretty rose;
</p>
<p>
I liked to feel her silky dress.
</p>
<p>
She held a very little book
</p>
<p>
And asked the things for us to guess.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She asked about Who-made-y-God,
</p>
<p>
And never seemed to fuss or frown;
</p>
<p>
I liked to watch her little tongue
</p>
<p>
And see it wriggle up and down.

THE WOODPECKER
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The woodpecker pecked out a little round hole
</p>
<p>
And made him a house in the telephone pole.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
One day when I watched he poked out his head,
</p>
<p>
And he had on a hood and a collar of red.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When the streams of rain pour out of the sky,
</p>
<p>
And the sparkles of lightning go flashing by,

And the big, big wheels of thunder roll,
</p>
<p>
He can snuggle back in the telephone pole.

THE BUTTERBEAN TENT

<p>
All through the garden I went and went,
</p>
<p>
And I walked in under the butterbean tent.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The poles leaned up like a good tepee
</p>
<p>
And made a nice little house for me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I had a hard brown clod for a seat,
</p>
<p>
And all outside was a cool green street.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A little green worm and a butterfly
</p>
<p>
And a cricket-like thing that could hop went by.

<div class="stanza">

Hidden away there were flocks and flocks
</p>
<p>
Of bugs that could go like little clocks.

Such a good day it was when I spent

Our brother Clarence goes to school.

He has a slate and a blue school-bag.

He has a book and a copybook

And a scholar's companion and a little slate rag.

He knows a boy named Joe B. Kirk,

And he learns about c-a-t cat,

And how to play one-two-sky-blue,

<p>
And how to make a football out of a hat.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We climb up on the fence and gate

And watch until he's small and dim,

To see if we keep on watching him.

On Sunday morning, then he comes

And camphor balls from Mr. Wells.

No matter&#8212;that's what Father said.

That Mr. Wells is coming in.

DICK AND WILL
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Our brother says that Will was born
</p>
<p>
The very day that Dickie came;
</p>
<p>
When one is four the other is,
</p>
<p>
And all their birthdays are the same.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Their coats and waists are just alike;
</p>
<p>
They have their hats together, too.
</p>
<p>
They sleep together in one bed,
</p>
<p>
And Will can put on Dickie's shoe.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But they are not the same at all;
</p>
<p>
Two different boys they have to be,
</p>
<p>
For Dick can play in Mother's room
</p>
<p>
When Will is climbing in a tree.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Or maybe Will is on the porch
</p>
<p>
To cry because he stubbed his toe,
</p>
<p>
And Dick is laughing by the gate
</p>
<p>
And watching ants go in a row.

<p>
The church has pieces jutting out

<p>
Where corners of the walls begin.

I have one for my little house,

And I can feel myself go in.

I feel myself go in the bricks,

I'm always waiting all alone,

I'm sitting on a little chair.

For something that is never there,

For something that is gone.

LITTLE RAIN

<div class="poem">

<p>
When I was making myself a game
</p>
<p>
Up in the garden, a little rain came.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It fell down quick in a sort of rush,
</p>
<p>
And I crawled back under the snowball bush.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I could hear the big drops hit the ground
</p>
<p>
And see little puddles of dust fly round.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A chicken came till the rain was gone;
</p>
<p>
He had just a very few feathers on.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He shivered a little under his skin,
</p>
<p>
And then he shut his eyeballs in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Even after the rain had begun to hush
</p>
<p>
It kept on raining up in the bush.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
One big flat drop came sliding down,
</p>
<p>
And a ladybug that was red and brown
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Was up on a little stem waiting there,
</p>
<p>
And I got some rain in my hair.

THE PULPIT

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
On Sunday when I go to church
</p>
<p>
I wear my dress that's trimmed with lace.
</p>
<p>
I sit beside my mother and
</p>
<p>
Am very quiet in my place.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When Dr. Brown is reading hymns
</p>
<p>
To make the people want to sing,

<p>
Or when he preaches loud and makes
</p>
<p>
The shivery bells begin to ring,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I watch the little pulpit house&#8212;
</p>
<p>
It isn't very tall or wide&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And then I wonder all about
</p>
<p>
The little ones that live inside.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
When Dr. Brown has preached enough,
</p>
<p>
And when he is about to stop,
</p>
<p>
He stands behind the little house
</p>
<p>
And shuts the Bible on the top.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I wonder if

they

sit inside,
</p>
<p>
And if

they

cook and walk up stairs.
</p>
<p>
I wonder if
<i>
they
</i>
have a cat
</p>
<p>
And say some kind of little prayers.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I wonder if
<i>
they're

ever scared
</p>
<p>
Because the bedroom lamp goes out,

<p>
And what their little dreams are like
</p>
<p>
And what

they

wonder all about.

ON THE HILL

<div class="poem">

<p>
Mother said that we could go
</p>
<p>
Up on the hill where the strawberries grow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And while I was there I looked all down,
</p>
<p>
Over the trees and over the town.
</p>
</div>

<p>
I saw the field where the big boys play,
</p>
<p>
And the roads that come from every way,

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The courthouse place where the wagons stop,
</p>
<p>
And the bridge and the scales and the blacksmith shop.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The church steeple looked very tall and thin,
</p>
<p>
And I found the house that we live in.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw it under the poplar tree,
</p>
<p>
And I bent my head and tried to see
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Our house when the rain is over it,
</p>
<p>
And how it looks when the lamps are lit.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw the swing from up on the hill,
</p>
<p>
The ropes were hanging very still.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And over and over I tried to see
</p>
<p>
Some of us walking under the tree,

And the children playing everywhere,
</p>
<p>
And how it looks when I am there.

He stood some cornstalks by the fence

<p>
And had them for the men that vote.

Then he climbed on a box and made a speech

To the cornstalk men that were in a row.

He sings us a song or tells a piece;

I'd hear a kind of gentle talk.

And have a pinkish color on.

To feel how he could hold it tight.

STRANGE TREE

<p>
Away beyond the Jarboe house

<p>
I saw a different kind of tree.

<p>
Its trunk was old and large and bent,

<p>
And I could feel it look at me.

The road was going on and on

And yet it did not have a face.

It looked at me with all its limbs;

Were bent and dark.

That had a little worm inside.

We watched him pucker up himself

He tried to go inside the dirt,

Awhile, and tried to answer it.

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We like to listen to her dress,
</p>
<p>
It makes a whisper by her feet.
</p>
<p>
Her little pointed shoes are gray;
</p>
<p>
She hardly lets them touch the street.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Sometimes she has a crumpled fan.
</p>
<p>
Her hat is silvered on the crown.
</p>
<p>
And there are roses by the brim
</p>
<p>
That nod and tremble up and down.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She comes along the pavement walk,
</p>
<p>
And in a moment she is gone.
</p>
<p>
She hardly ever looks at us,
</p>
<p>
But once she smiled and looked at John.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And so we run to see her pass
</p>
<p>
And watch her through the fence, and I
</p>
<p>
Can hear the others whispering,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Miss Josephine is going by.&#34;

SHELLS IN ROCK
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I've been along the quarry road,
</p>
<p>
And I have watched men digging wells,
</p>
<p>
And everywhere it was the same&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The stones were full of little shells.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And they are packed away in rock;
</p>
<p>
They're under sand and under clay;
</p>
<p>
And some one said that they were left
</p>
<p>
When the ocean went away.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I saw them in the stones that make
</p>
<p>
A church, and in a bridge.
</p>
<p>
They're hidden in the solid rock
</p>
<p>
But they show along the edge.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
You see them in foundation stones;
</p>
<p>
They show in creeks and waterfalls;
</p>
<p>
And once I saw them on the jail&#8212;
</p>
<p>
More little shells in walls.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We walk on them when we walk on roads;
</p>
<p>
And they're packed under all the hills.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the sea should come back here
</p>
<p>
And gather up its shells.

HORSE
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His bridle hung around the post.
</p>
<p>
The sun and the leaves made spots come down;
</p>
<p>
I looked close at him through the fence;
</p>
<p>
The post was drab and he was brown.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His nose was long and hard and still,
</p>
<p>
And on his lip were specks like chalk.
</p>
<p>
But once he opened up his eyes,
</p>
<p>
And he began to talk.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He didn't talk out with his mouth;
</p>
<p>
He didn't talk with words or noise.
</p>
<p>
The talk was there along his nose;
</p>
<p>
It seemed and then it was.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He said the day was hot and slow,
</p>
<p>
And he said he didn't like the flies;
</p>
<p>
They made him have to shake his skin,
</p>
<p>
And they got drowned in his eyes.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He said that drab was just about
</p>
<p>
The same as brown, but he was not
</p>
<p>
A post, he said, to hold a fence.
</p>
<p>
&#34;I'm horse,&#34; he said, &#34;that's what!&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And then he shut his eyes again.
</p>
<p>
As still as they had been before.
</p>
<p>
He said for me to run along
</p>
<p>
And not to bother him any more.

We had to wait for the heat to pass,

And I was lying on the grass,

And I saw how many stars there were.

Beyond the tree, beyond the air,

And more and more were always there.

So many that I think they must

Be sprinkled on the sky like dust.

<p>
A dust is coming through the sky!
</p>
<p>
And I felt myself begin to cry.

So many of them and so small,

One day they came; I heard their feet.

They made a tapping on the street.

And as they passed before our trees,

<p>
Their shawls blew out in curves like threes,

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
